VoteWave: A Decentralized Voting & Polling Tool for Clubs and Communities

🎯 Project Description:

VoteWave is a fast, secure, and user-friendly decentralized application (dApp) built on Shardeum Unstablenet. It enables clubs, DAOs, and communities to create tamper-proof polls and conduct transparent voting—whether it's electing leadership, deciding on events, or making policy decisions.

Powered by Shardeum’s EVM-compatible smart contracts, VoteWave showcases the speed, scalability, and ultra-low gas fees of the Shardeum network, making democratic participation accessible and cost-effective for all users.

🧑‍⚖️ Secure Voting: Votes are recorded immutably on-chain, ensuring transparency and preventing double voting.

⚡ Real-Time Results: Poll results update live, showcasing Shardeum's lightning-fast finality.

💸 Low Gas Costs: Voting costs just a fraction of a cent, making it feasible for daily use, even in large communities.

🖼️ Animated UI: The front end is designed with smooth animations, micro-interactions, and a vibrant UI/UX for an engaging experience.

📱 Mobile Responsive: Built with full responsiveness to ensure accessibility on all devices.

🧱 Tech Stack:

Blockchain: Shardeum Unstablenet (EVM-compatible)

Smart Contracts: Solidity

Frontend: React.js + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion for animations

Wallet Integration: MetaMask / Shardeum-compatible wallets via Web3.js or Ethers.js

Backend (if needed): Node.js + Express (for off-chain access control or metadata)
